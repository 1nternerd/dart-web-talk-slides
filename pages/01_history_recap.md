# Quick Dart history recap

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Originally released in 2011
- Initial plans included to build the Dart VM into Chrome
    - Many V8 engineers work(ed) on the VM as well
- Since Dart 1.9 it compiles to JS
- ðŸ”¥ _hot news_: Starting with Dart 3.3.0, the `dart:html` package will get more and more deprecated 
    - `package:web` will be replacing it as it will work with the Dart wasm compiler

<!--
The plans for dart initially:
- make Javascript typesafe

When Dart would be embedded in browser engines it would probably have been superior
