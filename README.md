# Dart Web talk slides

This repo contains the [sli.dev](https://sli.dev) slides to my talk about Dart Web and how web frameworks can work in a web context.  

The slide notes are written as HTML comments in the markdown files in `pages/*` and contain some (hopefully most relevant stuff) that I told during my talk.
