# Dart Web talk slides

This repo contains the [sli.dev](https://sli.dev) slides to my talk about Dart Web and how web frameworks can work in a web context.  

The slide notes are written as HTML comments in the markdown files in `pages/*` and contain some (hopefully most relevant stuff) that I told during my talk.

You can also look at the rendered slides in the [Github pages deployment](https://1nternerd.github.io/dart-web-talk-slides/).  
For more information on how the slidev interface works, have a look at their docs on how to open up the presenter view in the slides: https://sli.dev/guide/presenter-mode
